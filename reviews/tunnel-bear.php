          <h3>Our Score: 3.5/5</h3>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>TunnelBear is one of the few VPN providers that is simply designed and easy to use while still offering highly functional security features. You don’t have to compromise between the two with this provider.  Charming name and teddy bear interface aside, the service provides powerful and extensive data security and encryption. </p>
          
            <p>Their pricing is not bad either. Although their unlimited subscriptions are on par with other providers, they offer more than many. But TunnelBear offers a free service that allows up to 500 MB of data per month, which is something very few providers offer. </p>

            <p>TunnelBear also takes privacy very seriously. They never log any of your activity, and their privacy policy has even won awards. 
            The only major downside to TunnelBear is their lack of servers and locations. TunnelBear only has servers in about 20 countries worldwide, so there are still many countries that are unable to access TunnelBear.</p>

          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>TunnelBear has what might be the easiest setup amongst all VPN providers, and you can even start out with a free account. Simply sign up for an account on their website using your email address and a password and download their client. Install the program to your device. It will change some of the settings on your device, but it’s nothing that can’t be reversed, and most of the changes are unnoticeable. </p>
          <p>Once you’re installed and logged in, you’ll see the amount of data you have left for the month in the top right corner of your device. If you’re a paying customer, you won’t see this meter, because you have unlimited data. </p>
          
          <h2>Features &amp; Key USP</h2>
          <p>One of the most unique features of TunnelBear is their free subscription. Most VPNs offer a free trial, but rarely do they offer a fully free subscription. TunnelBear allows free subscribers to use up to 500 MB of data per month, which isn’t a lot, but it’s a good amount given the price. After that, paid users get unlimited data. </p>

          <p>TunnelBear strives to be very user-friendly, and thus they offer the option to always automatically connect to the closest server from your location. That way, you don’t have to bother with trying to choose a server each time you want to connect.  </p>
          
          <p>Another thing TunnelBear is known for are their robust privacy services. They’ve actually won awards for the privacy policy. TunnelBear will never log your activity. What’s more, they have extra features such as vigilant mode, which will block any unsecured traffic from your system if your connection is disrupted. </p>
          
          <p>TunnelBear’s encryption services are strong. They offer an AES 256-bit encryption as their default option. </p>

              </div>
          
<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p>TunnelBear is very reliable when it comes to keeping its users activity private and secured. They are a highly trusted VPN with fantastic reviews. The one area in which they fall short is lack of servers and location ability, so users do sometimes find that they are unable to connect to the service.  </p>

          <h2>Speed</h2>
<p>Despite having fewer servers, TunnelBear’s speed is pretty on par with other VPN providers. On a recent speed tests, download speeds were decreased by 6.7%, which is pretty average. Upload speeds were a bit worse – they were decreased by 8%.  </p>

          <h2>Countries Available</h2>
<p>TunnelBear is still only available in 20 countries worldwide. Those countries are the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Netherlands, Australia, Hong Kong, Mexico, United States, Japan, France, Sweden, Singapore, Denmark, India, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, and Norway.  </p>

          <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
          <p>TunnelBear is one of the best VPN Providers out there in terms of usability and privacy. They’ve done a great job of building a very solid product with extensive features and ease of use, two things that don’t often go together. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they haven’t quite built up the user-base or the servers that other VPNs have. They’re only operational in 20 countries, and while their speeds aren’t bad, they aren’t impressive either. That being said, because they’re one of the few VPN providers to offer a free subscription, it’s definitely worth trying them out. </p>
